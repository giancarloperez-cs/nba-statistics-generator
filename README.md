# nba-statistics-generator

Do you ever wonder about statlines from various players in the NBA? Maybe you don't have enough time throughout the season to be checking everyones stats from every single game. Well, this app solves that problem by allowing you to do various things such as generate a statline from a random player during a random game, generating a statline from a random game of a player that the user searched for, and being able to add players to a favorites list.
